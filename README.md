# ExploreMarineDataUsf
Project led by Dr. Meyers, analyzing water level data and generating corresponding graphs and figures to provide more insight. This project explores marine data using Python, focusing on analyzing monthly anomalies in water levels across various NOAA stations. It includes scripts to compute monthly averages, anomalies relative to climatological averages, and correlation matrices to visualize relationships between station data. The analysis involves processing NOAA data from .mat files, converting datetime formats, and generating heatmaps to depict correlation strengths. Additionally, the project includes functions to identify high-correlation stations and produce insightful visualizations for further data interpretation.
